    <h2>Cappuccino</h2>

    <p>
      Now a famous Italian coffee, cappuccino is an espresso-based java that
      comes from an Austrian drink called kapuziner (via Super Coffee). Inspired
      by the dark color of robes worn by Kapuzin friars of Austria in the 1700s,
      kapuziner was made with coffee, milk, sugar, and a swirl of whipped cream
      on top. What we now know as cappuccino, Perfect Daily Grind explains, was
      concocted by Italians in the 1900s for whom cappuccino was the ideal
      morning coffee that could be drunk in a handful of gulps for a quick jolt
      of caffeine. While the exact method to making a cappuccino differs between
      leading coffee institutions of the world, Super Coffee writes that a 1:1:1
      ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk is generally followed in
      the U.S. That is, a cappuccino is usually one-third espresso and one-third
      steamed milk, followed by one-third of creamy milk foam on top. Per Daily
      Perfect Grind, when brewed by a skilled barista, the steamed milk and milk
      foam will form layers over the espresso instead of blending into it. The
      layers are the biggest giveaway that visibly distinguishes a cappuccino
      from other milk-based espresso coffees. This is also why a cappuccino
      usually tastes more intense than its milky counterparts and highlights the
      flavor of the coffee beans much better whilst giving a creamier mouthfeel.

    <h2>Cortado</h2>

    />
    <p>
      The origin of this espresso-based coffee can be traced back to Spain's
      Basque County, where cortado was given its name after the Spanish verb
      cortar, meaning to cut (per Perfect Daily Grind). A smaller version of a
      cappuccino, Roasty Coffee says that a cortado has just enough milk "to
      cut" the espresso and its acidity. Equal parts of milk and espresso are
      used to brew a cortado. As Roasty Coffee reports, the milk, although
      steamed, has little to no foam. While the lack of froth means that cortado
      isn't as creamy as other coffees that use foamed milk, it also means that
      the steamed milk will blend smoothly into the espresso without forming
      layers. According to Bon Appétit. This makes cortado a very balanced
      coffee, only a small amount of milk allows the flavors of the espresso to
      shine without being too intense or milky. Traditionally, you will find a
      cortado served in a small metal or glass tumbler and it usually lacks any
      latte art on top. While most coffees come in different sizes, a cortado is
      a drink that is meant to be small, and so is almost always served in one
      standard size even at famous coffee chains. Read More:

    <h2>Latte</h2>

    <p>
      Although cappuccino has Austrian roots, sources are clear that Italians
      popularized the foamy drink in the 1900s. Latte, on the other hand (though
      Italian in origin) was not meant for Italians to drink at all! According
      to Coffee Bros., the caffè latte was invented in 1867 for American
      tourists in Italy for whom the Italian cappuccino was too strong a coffee.
      Consequently, the latte was fashioned to be a less intense and
      considerably more milky version of a cappuccino for not-so-strong
      coffee-loving Americans. Typically, a latte is served in a glass as
      opposed to a mug and contains mainly espresso and steamed milk with only a
      thin layer of foam on top, per Coffee Bros. Because of the high quantity
      of milk — which is more significant than most espresso-based drinks — a
      latte tends to mask the flavor of the espresso well, making it a solid
      option for anybody who doesn't much care about the flavor of coffee and
      only wants it for its caffeine kick. Furthermore, Coffee Bros. writes that
      the milky taste of a latte, which has only a mild hint of espresso, also
      explains why lattes are perhaps more popular than any other hot coffee
      when adding all sorts of syrups and flavors. Read More:

    <h2>Red eye</h2>

    />
    <p>
      If the name doesn't already give it away, the red eye coffee is named
      after a red-eye flight that flies across countries through the night and
      often leaves travelers with red eyes from exhaustion (via Trade).
      Unsurprisingly, the red eye is a very, very strong drink. Unlike most
      other coffees that blend the source of caffeine with water, milk, or other
      non-caffeinated mix-ins, the red eye combines coffee with ... more
      coffee.  Originally a secret menu item at Starbucks, Trade writes that red
      eye coffees can now be found everywhere. The drink is essentially just a
      cup of regular drip coffee but with the addition of a shot of espresso on
      top. The taste of a red eye coffee is often compared to an Americano,
      except it has more body. Although the coffee is intense, Trade finds that
      the sweet flavor of drip coffee works well with bitter espresso. While the
      red eye usually adds one shot of espresso to drip coffee, A Couple Cooks
      notes that stronger versions of this already-strong coffee exist too. A
      black eye uses two espresso shots with its drip coffee, whereas a green
      eye or dead eye uses three. If there was ever a coffee to help pull
      through an especially sluggish day or a long all-nighter, something
      stronger than a red eye is going to be hard to find. Read More:
